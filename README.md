# Introduction
This is a test project for visualizing the Breadth First Search algorithm.
## Prerequsites
 * QT 5/6
 * CMake 3.5
 * GCC 13

## Description
When starting the program, you must set the number of cells to generate the field.

> The minimum possible field size is 5 x 5.

Next, when you click on the left mouse button(LMB), a starting point will be created. When pressed LMB again, a finishing point will be created and the BFS algorithm will start. The finishing point can be moved by pressing LMB again.

* Red rectangle - start point
* Blue rectangle - finish point
* Green line - the shortest path from start to finish

> Field can be scaled using the mouse wheel.
